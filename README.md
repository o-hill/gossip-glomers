# Gossip Glomers

This is an implementation of the Fly.io [distributed systems challenges](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) in rust. I worked through John Gjengset's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gboGyccRVXI) and then extended that work into the rest of the challenges. Thanks to Fly.io and [Kyle Kingsbury](https://github.com/aphyr/).
